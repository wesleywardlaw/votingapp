#Voting App

This is a RESTful application that uses React, Redux, Passport, MongoDB, Express, and Node to allow users to create and share polls.

It was designed according to the user stories on Free Code Camp:

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. 

User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
